# animal_game_engine
ggez engine with some physics and body animation written on top.

## 'Roadmap'
Every part should be able to bear future changes and extensions to allow programming without too detailed plans.

The lists in the subsections are **not** exhaustive.

### general setup


### graphics
* draw various objects including images
* varying window sizes

#### (potential) future extensions
* drawing light
* drawing to a specifig surface/canvas
* drawing fluids

### physics
* applying forces to objects (e.g. hitting each other)
    * hitting
    * throwing
    * grabbing
* dynamic (movable) vs. static (unmovable) objects

#### (potential) future extensions
* fluids

### animal bodies
* not sprites but body parts that move individually
* bone system for movements
